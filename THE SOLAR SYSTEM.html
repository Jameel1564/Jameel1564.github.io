                From Molecules to Moons, Planets, and Solar Systems.
                <br>Simple chemical molecules orbiting young stars created the Goldilocks
                conditions for our next threshold of increasing complexity, because they
                provided the building blocks for entirely new astronomical objects: planets,
                moons, and asteroids. Planetary bodies were chemically richer than stars,
                and much cooler, so they offered ideal Goldilocks environments for
                complex chemistry. And on at least one planet (our own), and probably on
                many more, that chemistry would eventually generate life.

        <h2>THE BIRTH OF THE SUN</h2>
        <p>
          It was five billion years ago. A giant cloud of matter in our own galaxy, the Milky Way,
          condensed under its gravity, exploding in nuclear fusion. This fusion released what we call
          sunshine. Very, very, very hot sunshine. And the newly formed star was our Sun. It drew in
          most of the surrounding matter, but some escaped. And some of this material clumped together,
          settling into a protoplanetary orbit.
        </p>
        <h2>WHY IS IT CALLED THE SOLAR SYSTEM?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many planetary systems like ours in the universe, with planets 
            orbiting a host star. Our planetary system is called “the solar system” 
            because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, 
            after the Latin word for Sun, "solis."
        </p>
        <p>
            We	have	a	lot	to	thank	the	sun	for:	heat,	light	and	
            energy	for	a	start.	We	also	have to	thank it for the	
            Earth's	creation.

          Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity - 
          the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets 
          such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

        <h2>HOW DID THE PLANETS FORM?</h2>
        <p>
            The	formation	of	planets	is	a	messy	by-product	of	star	
            creation,	which	takes	place	in	areas	of	space	rich	in	
            clouds	of	chemicals.

        </p>
        <p>
            After	the	star	at	the	center	of	our	solar	system	- our	
            sun	- was	formed,	a	mass	of	debris	made	up	of	gas,	
            dust	and	particles	of	ice	was	left	over,	while	lighter	
            elements	such	as	hydrogen	and	helium	were	blasted	
            away	by	violent	bursts	from	the	sun.	That's	why	the	
            outer	planets	in	our	solar	system	are	formed	mainly	
            from	these	elements.	But	closer	to the	sun,	where	
            rocky	planets	like	Earth,	Venus	and	Mars	were	formed,	
            was	an	area	rich	in	chemicals	like	oxygen,	aluminum	
            and	iron.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over	time,	particles	of	matter	stuck	together	as	they	
            collided	in	orbit.	Eventually	larger	objects	such	as	
            meteors	emerged, which	were	large	enough	that	their	
            gravity	sucked	up	surrounding	debris.	Eventually,	this	
            led	to	the	formation	of	planets.
            <br>The	signs	of	this	process	remain	visible	today.
        </p>
        <p>
            The	slightly	strange	tilt	of	Uranus	and	its	rings	is	most	
            likely	the	result	of	a	violent	collision	with	another	form,	
            while	our	moon	was	probably	created	by	a	collision	
            between	Earth	and	a	Mars-sized	protoplanet	(a	kind	of	
            early,	pre-planet).	That	collision	sent	vast	quantities	of	
            matter	into	a	circular	orbit	around	Earth,	like	the	rings	
            of	Saturn,	before	eventually	coming	together	to	form	
            the	moon.
        </p>
        <p>
            For	a	long	time,	humans	have	known	only	of	our	own	
            solar	system	- the	collection	of	planets,	moons	and	
            debris	orbiting	the	sun.	But	in	the	last	30	years,	we've	
            learned	that	most	stars	have	planets.	There	could	be	
            many	billions	of	different	kinds	of	planets	in	the	
            universe.	Studies	by	astronomists	will,	in	time,	reveal	
            how	many	could	support	life.	But	what	conditions	
            enable	life	on	a	planet?
