                    Throughout	history, humans	have tried to make	sense	
                    of	our	world	and	our	place	in	it.	People	from	different	
                    ages,	races	and	religions	have	told	stories	to	explain,	
                    with	grandeur	and	awe,	the	origins	and	existence	of	
                    humans,	animals,	Earth,	the	stars	and	the	universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Globalization	and	our	intensely	dynamic	modern	
                    knowledge	economy	have	eroded	faith	in	traditional	
                    origin	stories.	But	the	reality	is	that	current	scientific	
                    knowledge	means	humans	have	never	been	better	
                    placed	to	explain	our	origins	and	development.

                <p>
                    The	tale	of	our	origins	is	told	through	thresholds, key	
                    transition	points	when	more	complex	things	appeared.	
                    These	moments	happen	under	what's	known	as	
                    goldilocks	conditions,	when	things	are	not	too	hot	or	
                    too	cold, but just right.

                    For	most	of	the	thresholds	in	our	story,	we	can	explain	
                    what	those	goldilocks	conditions	were,	and	why	the	
                    threshold	was	reached.	But	what	about	the	Big	Bang?

                <img src="images/UniverseTimeline.jpg" class="img-fluid center"/>
                <p>
                    We	simply	don't	know	the	conditions	that	allowed	our	
                    universe	to	emerge.	Perhaps	the	best	way	to	explain	
                    what	happened	is	to	use	the	words	of	science	fiction	
                    author	Terry	Pratchett:	“In	the	beginning,	there	was	
                    nothing,	which	exploded.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    What	we	do	know	is	that	the	Big	Bang	created	the	
                    universe	13.8	billion	years	ago, the	first	of	a	series	of	
                    key	events	in	our	history.	 And	we	know	what	
                    happened	next,	a	fraction	of	a	billionth	of	a	second	
                    after	that	moment.
                </p>
                <P>
                    At	this	point,	the	universe	was	smaller	than	an	atom.	
                    It's	hard	for	human	brains	to	comprehend	the	size	of	
                    things	like	atoms,	but	you	could	comfortably	fit	a	
                    million	of	them	into	the	dot	of	this <strong>"i"</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To	begin	with,	we	only	had	energy,	which	quickly	split	
                    into	different	forces,	such	as	gravity	and	
                    electromagnetism.	Within	a	second,	simple	matter	
                    emerged	and	was	followed	by	more	complex	
                    structures,	while	protons	and	neutrons extremely	
                    tiny	particles teamed	up	to	become	nuclei.	All	this	
                    happened	within	minutes,	but	as	the	universe	cooled	
                    things	slowed	down	a	bit.	380,000	years	later,	
                    electrons	became	trapped	in	orbit	around	protons,	
                    pulled	together	by	electromagnetic	forces,	and	the	first	
                    atoms of	helium	and	hydrogen	were	formed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The	universe	began	as	something	unimaginably	small,	
                    with	all	the	energy	and	matter	present	in	the	universe	
                    today	packed	into	it,	and	it's	been	growing	ever	since.
