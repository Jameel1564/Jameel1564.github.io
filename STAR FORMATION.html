                Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the 
                most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition
                of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. 
                Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements
                such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to
                the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently,
                the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.

        <h2>BILLIONS OF STARS</h2>
        <p>
            Looking	at	the	night	sky,	it's	easy	to	think	of	stars	as	
            having	always	existed.	But	stars	only	came	into	being	a	
            hundred	million	years	after	the	Big	Bang,	when	gravity	
            and	matter	provided	the	goldilocks	conditions	for	stars	
            to	form.
        </p>
        <p>
            At	this	point,	the	universe	was	a	bit	like	a	mist	made	up	
            of	tiny	pieces	of	matter.	In	some	areas, you	could	
            think	of	them	as	particularly	cloudy	areas, the	volume	
            of	matter	was	denser	than	elsewhere.	Here,	gravity
            pulled	atoms	together,	making	them	collide	and	speed	
            up,	raising	the	temperature.	Over	time,	these	clouds	of	
            matter	grew	denser	and	hotter.
        </p>
        <p>
            When	a	cloud	of	matter's	core	hits	10	million	degrees,	
            trillions	of	protons	will	fuse	together	to	form	helium	
            nuclei.	In	this	fusion,	huge	amounts	of	energy	are	
            released, the	same	process	that	occurs	in	a	hydrogen	
            bomb	explosion.	A	furnace	is	created,	releasing	vast	
            energy	that	will	burn	as	long	as	there	are	still	protons	
            to	fuse	together.	The	structure	stabilizes	and	will	last	
            for	millions,	even	billions	of	years.	We	have	a	star.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually,	we	now	have	many	stars,	bound	together	in	
            galaxies kind	of	like	star	cities.	Our	galaxy,	the	Milky	
            Way,	contains	hundreds	of	billions	of	stars, including our SUN.
        </p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
            But	it's	not	just	the	birth	of	a	star,	but	also	their	death	
            that	represented	an	important	step	forward	for	our	
            universe,	and	eventually,	for	us.
        </p>
        <h2>
            THE LIFECYCLE OF STARS
        </h2>
        <p>
            When	a	large	star	dies,	gravity	smashes	the	star's	core	
            together	with	extreme	force,	and	the	star	explodes	
            with,	for	an	instant,	as	much	energy	as	an	entire	
            galaxy.	In	just	a	few	moments,	this	explosion	
            manufactures	most	of	the	elements	we	find	in	the	
            periodic	table	and	sends	them	flying	out	into	space.	
            Star	deaths	fertilized	and	enriched	our	universe,	
            ultimately	enabling	the	formation	of	our	earth	in	a	
            form	that	would	eventually	support	life.
